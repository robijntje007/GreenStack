# For the developers

If you want to dig into our new shop we have provided you with some new [simulations of our shop](GreenStoreTests/TextTestFixture.cs). <br/>
It should be the default of our test project so just running it would also work. <br/>
If you still want to learn more about how our shop works you are in luck! <br/>
In the [GreenStoreTests](GreenStoreTests/GreenStoreTest.cs) we have provided you with a comprehensive overview of what our new shop is capable of. <br/>

If you don't understand everything, that's okay young samurai! <br/>
We have some resources for you to go through to get you up to speed:

* [AutoBogus](https://github.com/nickdodd79/AutoBogus) for generating test data.
* [Fluent Assertions](https://fluentassertions.com/) for making testing even easier.
* [GreenStack](https://greenstack.be/) for making damn good software.

For the original spec sheet have a look at [our requirements](GreenStoreRequirements.txt).
